BOOK III

Telemachus and Athena arrived at Pylos and meet Nestor, the city's king.  Nestor told the pair that he has no information of Odysseus, but told them the story of Agamemnon's betrayal of faith by his wife upon his return to Greece, and of his retribution through his son Orestes.  Nestor lent one of his chariots for Telemachus to take to Menelaos' mansion.
